>   ... Because, I love a good mystery story ... Especially, when it involves *DATA* ...  


I have been working in the IT industry for the past 15+ years mastering data analytics with a niche product - Oracle Business Intelligence (OBIEE) and supporting technologies such as Informatica (ETL),  data warehousing and data modeling.  My work in this area of technology opened up several wonderful opportunities for me to gain experience using these techologies as a Sr. Principal Instructor and Sr. Principal Program Manager.

After spending several years working with business users, upper-level management and stakeholders finding answers to a given set of questions from the data, for example, *"Show me X by Y by Z"*.  I realized that as a data scientist I could ask a very different question of the data, such as,  "*Show me the future prediction of this data  based on past patterns*".  

> This is the level of insight about the data that I am interested in learning more about.
